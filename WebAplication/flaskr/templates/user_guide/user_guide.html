        This section provides an easy-to-understand user guide for the Smart X-Ray Screening application, including step-by-step instructions on how to upload X-Ray images and understand the data resulted from the analysis.
    </p>

    <h2>What type of images are accepted</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
    The Smart X-Ray Screening application is designed to analyze chest X-Ray images. 
    It is important to ensure that the images you upload are indeed chest X-Rays, as the application is specifically trained to interpret this type of medical imaging. <br>
    Acceptable image formats include common types such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP.
    </p>

    <h2>How to upload an image</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Uploading an X-Ray image to the Smart X-Ray Screening application is a straightforward process. 
    It is also a crucial step, since it is imposibble to start the analysis without first uploading an image. <br>
    In order to upload an X-Ray image for analysis, you need to click on the blue "Upload" button located on the home page of the application. 
    This will open a file selection dialog where you can choose the X-Ray image file from your device. 
    After selecting the desired image file, click on the "Open" button in the file dialog.<br>
    You will then see the name of the selected file displayed above the "Upload" button, and you will be able to see a preview of the image, so you can ensure that the right image was picked. <br>
    It is important to note that it is not possible to upload multiple images at once; only one image can be uploaded at a time.
    The last step after uploading the image and before being able to start the analysis by clicking on the "Submit" button is to select the patient's sex and age from the provided dropdown menus.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding the results</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Once the analysis of the uploaded X-Ray image is complete, the Smart X-Ray Screening application provides a detailed results page that includes several key components to help you understand the findings. <br>
    The results page features an annotated image area where the analyzed X-Ray image is displayed with red bounding boxes highlighting any detected abnormalities. 
    This visual representation allows you to easily identify areas of concern within the X-Ray. <br>
    Alongside the annotated image, there is a summary section that provides an overview of the analysis results. 
    This section includes the total number of diseases found in the X-Ray image, giving you a quick snapshot of the patient's condition. <br>
    Additionally, a detailed table lists each detected finding, including the class of abnormality, the confidence level of the detection, and the specific location within the X-Ray image. 
    This comprehensive breakdown allows for a deeper understanding of the analysis results, enabling you to make informed decisions based on the findings presented. <br>
    There is also the option to export the results as a PDF document for easy sharing and record-keeping, or to print the results directly from the application.
