X-Ray Preprocessing Pipeline Overview
This Documents creation was aided by GitHub Copilot.
=======================================

This preprocessing pipeline transforms raw X-ray images into standardized, enhanced images optimized for medical analysis and machine learning applications. The process consists of three main stages:

1. IMAGE STANDARDIZATION (Picture 1)
   The original X-ray image is resized to a fixed dimension of 2500 × 2048 pixels. This standardization ensures consistent dimensions for subsequent analysis algorithms and eliminates variations in image size that could affect processing results. The resizing maintains aspect ratio preservation while providing sufficient resolution for detailed medical analysis.

2. BRIGHTNESS RANGE OPTIMIZATION (Picture 2)
   The image undergoes brightness range maximization, where the darkest pixel is mapped to 0 and the brightest pixel to 255. This process utilizes the full available intensity spectrum (0-255) and significantly improves image contrast. This normalization step is crucial as it compensates for variations in X-ray exposure conditions and ensures optimal visibility of anatomical structures.

3. SOFT TISSUE ENHANCEMENT (Picture 3)
   Multiple advanced image processing techniques are applied sequentially to enhance soft tissue visibility:
   
   - Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) with optimized parameters for soft tissue structures
   - Gamma correction (γ=0.8) to enhance darker regions where soft tissues typically appear
   - Targeted lung field enhancement using morphological operations and region-specific masking
   - Cardiac silhouette enhancement through bilateral filtering and edge-preserving algorithms
   - Soft tissue edge enhancement using Difference of Gaussians (DoG) technique

The pipeline is specifically designed for detecting pneumonia, cardiac abnormalities, and soft tissue masses in chest X-rays. Each enhancement step is calibrated to preserve diagnostic information while improving the visibility of subtle pathological changes that may be missed in unprocessed images.

Technical Implementation: OpenCV library with NumPy arrays, supporting batch processing of multiple images with comprehensive error handling and progress reporting.
